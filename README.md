## ðŸŽ“ About Me
Hey there! My name is **Cherish**, and welcome to my STATS220 repository. Here's a quick update about me this semester:

- I'm currently studying towards my Bachelor of Science in **Statistics**.
- I chose STATS220 because I'm curious about combining **data visualisation** and **web technologies**.
- This semester, I'm especially excited to create **interactive web pages** and learn more about using **R for graphics and memes**.

## ðŸ“š Semester Goals
My objectives this semester include:

1. Mastering the `{magick}` and `{tidyverse}` R packages.
2. Building creative projects that I can showcase professionally.
3. Improving my skills in Markdown, HTML, and CSS for better data storytelling.
